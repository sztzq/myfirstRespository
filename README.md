it is the first time that I use GitHub
I am a graduated student from a General University. I major in Computer science and technology，but in the unversity，we majord learning how to develop. We studied many advanced language of programming，but I am not proficient in anyone of them，I know there is a long way to go.I want to use GitHub to make some records , at the same time I want to practice writting English.
